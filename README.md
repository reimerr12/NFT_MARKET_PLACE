# NFT Marketplace Platform

## Overview
The NFT Marketplace Platform is a comprehensive decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to create, buy, sell, and auction non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform provides a modern, responsive user interface with advanced marketplace functionality, supporting both fixed-price sales and auction mechanisms.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18 using functional components and hooks. It uses React Router for client-side navigation and Tailwind CSS with custom components for styling. State management is handled with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`). Blockchain interaction is powered by Ethers.js, while IPFS via Pinata is used for decentralized metadata and image storage.

### Smart Contract Architecture
The platform consists of two main smart contracts:

#### ImageNFT Contract (ERC-721 Token Contract)
**Location:** `ImageNFT.sol`  
**Purpose:** Manages NFT creation, minting, and royalty tracking.

**Key Features:**  
The contract is ERC-721 compliant with URI storage extension, has a built-in royalty system (0–5% maximum), integrates with the marketplace for creation tracking, supports owner-controlled marketplace address updates, and implements reentrancy protection for secure minting.  

**Core Functions:**  
- `mintNft(string memory _tokenURI, uint256 royaltyBps) external nonReentrant`  
- `getRoyalties(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address creator, uint256 bps)`  
- `setMarketPlace(address _marketplaceContract) external onlyOwner`  

**Contract Constants:**  
- `MAX_ROYALTY_BPS`: 500 (5% maximum royalty)  
- Token Symbol: `IMGNFT`  
- Token Name: `ImageNFT`  

#### NFTMarketplace Contract
**Location:** `NFTMarketplace.sol`  
**Purpose:** Handles all marketplace operations including listings, auctions, and transactions.

**Key Features:**  
The contract supports fixed-price listings, direct purchase functionality, a time-based auction system with a bidding mechanism, automatic royalty distribution to creators, and platform fee collection (10%). It implements efficient array management, user activity tracking, and secure transaction flows.  

**Core Constants:**  
- `FEE_PERCENT`: 10 (10% platform fee)  
- `BID_INCREMENT`: 0.01 ETH  
- `MAX_AUCTION_DURATION`: 30 days  
- `MIN_AUCTION_DURATION`: 1 hour  

**Blockchain Integration:**  
The system is compatible with Ethereum mainnet/testnet, uses ERC-721 with royalty extensions, implements `ReentrancyGuard` protection, and ensures gas optimization through efficient array management and batch operations.

## Core Features

### NFT Creation & Minting
The platform supports image uploads (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG formats, max 10MB), structured metadata storage on IPFS via Pinata, configurable creator royalties (0–5%), automatic registration with the marketplace contract, and on-chain token URI storage integrated with IPFS.

### Marketplace Operations
**Fixed Price Listings:** Direct buy/sell with immediate transfers, automatic fee and royalty distribution, optimized listing management, and cancel listing functionality.  
**Auction System:** Time-based auctions (1 hour to 30 days), minimum bid increment (0.01 ETH), bid refund system via withdrawable balances, reserve price functionality, auction cancellation if no bids, and automatic finalization after auction end.  
**Advanced Search & Filtering:** Multi-criteria filtering (price range, status, search terms), real-time marketplace data synchronization, multiple view modes (grid, list, mosaic), and pagination with configurable items per page.

### User Management
The platform integrates with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets. It supports portfolio tracking for created and purchased NFTs, withdrawable balances for auction refunds, transaction history logging via events, and efficient user activity tracking.

## Smart Contract Implementation Details

### ImageNFT Contract Structure
**State Variables:**  
- `uint256 public nextTokenId` (auto-incrementing token counter)  
- `uint256 public constant MAX_ROYALTY_BPS = 500` (5% max royalty)  
- `address public marketplaceContract` (marketplace integration)  
- `mapping(uint256 => address) public creators` (token creator tracking)  
- `mapping(uint256 => uint256) public royalties` (token royalty rates)  

**Security Features:**  
Reentrancy protection with `nonReentrant`, `Ownable` access control for marketplace updates, URI length and royalty bounds validation, and proper interface integration with the marketplace contract.

### NFTMarketplace Contract Structure
**Core Data Structures:**  
- `Listing`: Stores seller, price, auction status, and activity status.  
- `Auction`: Stores end time, highest bidder, highest bid, reserved price, finalization, and cancellation status.  

**Advanced Features:**  
The contract supports efficient array management, O(1) removal with index mappings, withdrawable balances for participants, and comprehensive tracking of user activity.

**Fee Distribution System:**  
- Platform Fee: 10% to contract owner  
- Creator Royalty: 0–5% to the original creator  
- Seller Payment: Remaining balance after fees

## IPFS Integration via Pinata

**Location:** `pinataService.js`  
**Purpose:** Provides IPFS integration for decentralized storage.  

**Core Capabilities:** Authentication with JWT and API keys, multi-format image upload, structured JSON metadata storage, batch operations, and pin/unpin management.  

**Upload Process:**  
1. Validate image file (format, size)  
2. Upload image to IPFS  
3. Create metadata with IPFS reference  
4. Upload metadata to IPFS  
5. Return complete IPFS references  

**Validation & Security:** Strict MIME type validation, 10MB max file size, robust error handling, and multiple IPFS gateway fallback.

## Technical Components

### HomePage Component
**Location:** `HomePage.js`  
A landing page that displays marketplace overview, trending NFTs, dynamic hero section with animations, real-time marketplace statistics, and onboarding features.  

### Marketplace Component
**Location:** `Marketplace.js`  
Main interface for browsing and purchasing NFTs. Fetches active listings and auctions, provides real-time price and status updates, and includes search and filtering functionality.  

### UserDashboard Component
**Location:** `UserDashboard.js`  
Personal NFT management interface. Displays created NFTs, purchased NFTs, marketplace listings, and withdrawable balances.  

### NFT Provider Hook
**Location:** `NFTProvider.js`

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **NFT Creation:** User input → file validation → IPFS upload (image, metadata) → smart contract mint → marketplace registration → UI update  
2. **Listing:** NFT selection → ownership verification → approval transaction → listing transaction → event emission → UI refresh  
3. **Auction Creation:** NFT selection → validation → approval → auction transaction → array tracking → UI update  
4. **Direct Purchase:** Buy request → validation → purchase transaction → fee distribution → transfer → UI update  
5. **Auction Bidding:** Bid placement → validation → transaction → refund → event emission → UI update

## Security Implementation

**Smart Contract Security:**  
Reentrancy protection with `nonReentrant`, safe transfer patterns, state changes before external calls, owner-only functions, proper ownership verification, input validation, reserve price and bid increment protection, and automatic fee distribution.  

**Frontend Security:**  
Sanitization of user inputs, prevention of XSS, no sensitive data stored in `localStorage`, and error boundaries for graceful recovery.  

---

## Performance Optimizations
